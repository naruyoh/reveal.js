						## Phase 1: Project Foundation & Definition
						### (Inception & Discovery)

						* **Goal:** To define the core problem, purpose, and initial scope of the project.
						* **Key Activities:**
							* **Problem Identification:** Pinpoint communication pain points, such as "employees feel unheard" or "managers burdened by repetitive queries".
							* **Core Purpose & Benefits:** Establish the primary goal of empowering subordinates to consult company policies independently and reducing supervisor workload by handling routine inquiries.
							* **Requirements Gathering:** Conduct user interviews with managers and employees to understand needs, including desired features like a **ChatGPT-style chatbot for employees** and a **dashboard with key indicators for managers**.
							* **Feasibility Study:** Assess technical, operational, and financial viability.
							* **Scope Definition (MVP):** Define the smallest valuable set of features for the initial release.
							* **Stakeholder Buy-in:** Secure commitment from management, HR, and IT.
						* **Duration:** The Proof of Concept (PoC) phase, which is part of this initial exploration, can range from **several weeks to a few months**.
						* **Outputs:** A problem statement, core purpose, preliminary feature list, feasibility report, initial scope, and stakeholder agreement. This phase also culminates in the PoC, yielding an **AI model prototype**, a **feature verification report**, and an **accuracy evaluation report**.

							* **Architecture Design (High-Level & Detailed):** Map data flow, system integrations, and security. Detail how application components will interact with specific AWS service APIs for each feature. The high-level architecture centers around a **serverless backend (AWS Lambda)**, **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL**, and a suite of **AWS AI/ML services**, with a **React frontend hosted on AWS Amplify**.
							* **Risk Management:** Identify potential risks like data quality, model bias, and user adoption, along with mitigation strategies.
							* **Team Formation & Roles:** Define roles for developers, data scientists, UI/UX, QA, AWS specialists, and content managers.
							* **User Experience (UX) & User Interface (UI) Design:** Create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes for the employee chat, manager dashboard, 1on1 history views, login flow, and file management, ensuring an intuitive and professional look.
							* **Database Design:** Develop a schema for **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL** to store user profiles, chat history, 1on1 meeting metadata, summarized content, AI-generated insights, and internal policy documents.
							* **AI Model Architecture Design:** Detail models for Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Speech-to-text, Summarization, Sentiment analysis, Entity extraction, and Predictive models.
							* **Data Pipeline Design:** Outline the flow of data from source to AWS services for processing, storage, and application display.

							* **Build Manager Dashboard UI:** Create the manager dashboard, displaying indicators such as the number of subordinates, and providing a **"START 1on1" button** for quick recording and summarization.
							* **Develop Employee List View:** Implement the list of subordinates (members).
							* **Implement Basic 1on1 History View:** Allow managers to review past session content in chronological order, focusing on structure without advanced AI insights.
						* **KPIs:** **Establish baseline for feature usage**.

						## Phase 4: Live 1on1 & Basic AI
						### (Months 4-6 of Development)

						* **Goal:** To enable live 1on1 recording and introduce initial AI features for managers.
						* **Key Activities:**
							* **Integrate Kinesis Video Streams:** Implement live audio/video capture from 1on1 sessions, feeding streams to AWS Transcribe.
							* **Integrate AWS Transcribe:** Process live audio to generate real-time, accurate transcripts of 1on1 meetings.
							* **Integrate AWS Comprehend:** Utilize Comprehend for meeting analysis to extract key phrases, determine sentiment, and generate initial summaries.
							* **Populate Manager Dashboard with Satisfaction Levels:** Begin displaying interview satisfaction levels on the manager dashboard, potentially derived from sentiment analysis.
							* **System Testing:** Rigorously test all AWS service integrations (e.g., Transcribe accuracy, Comprehend output quality).
						* **KPIs:** **Measure Meeting Feature Utility** and **Supervisor Burden Reduction (qualitative)**.

						## Analogy

						Building this AI communication tool is like **cultivating a smart garden**. You start by **preparing the soil and planting the foundational seeds** (Phase 1: Project Foundation), defining what you want to grow and why. Then, you **design the irrigation and support structures** (Phase 2: Detailed Planning), ensuring everything is in place for robust growth. Next, you **nurture the initial sprouts** (Phase 3: Manager MVP), seeing the first signs of functionality. As the garden matures, you **add automated watering and fertilization systems** (Phase 4: Live 1on1 & Basic AI) to enhance growth and introduce initial insights. You then **introduce specialized tools for specific plant needs** (Phase 5: Employee Chatbot & RAG) and **advanced sensors to optimize growing conditions** (Phase 6: Advanced AI & Insights). Finally, you **continuously tend the garden, prune, monitor for pests, and adapt to seasonal changes** (Phase 7: Deployment & Ongoing Operations), ensuring it remains vibrant and productive year after year.
